)

#### what?
A colab notebook for creating 4:5 portraits with Stable Diffusion.
- see notebook `portrait_diffusion.ipynb` 
- other notebooks are experiments preceding the construction of `portrait_diffusion.ipynb` 

#### why?
- Prompts like `"A portrait of..."` work best close to 512x512 resolution with Stable Diffusion
- But we can still get detailed images at this resolution

#### how?
- Good prompt engineering

### Sample output:
